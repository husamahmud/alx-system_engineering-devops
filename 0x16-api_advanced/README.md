# 0x16. API advanced

## Resources

#### Read or watch:

* [Reddit API Documentation](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/b-4nD6hwEeNYTwYl5yWNwA)
* [Query String](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/luFn_zrgmAQ0OAO_PEI9bA)

## Learning Objectives

### General

* How to read API documentation to find the endpoints youâ€™re looking for
* How to use an API with pagination
* How to parse JSON results from an API
* How to make a recursive API call
* How to sort a dictionary by value

## Tasks

## 0. How many subs?

- Write a function that queries the Reddit API and returns the number of
	subscribers (not active users, total subscribers) for a given subreddit. If an
	invalid subreddit is given, the function should return 0.

### Requirements:

Prototype: <code>def number_of_subscribers(subreddit)</code>
If not a valid subreddit, return 0.
NOTE: Invalid subreddits may return a redirect to search results. Ensure that
you are not following redirects.

Mode: mandatory

File: [0-subs.py](./0-subs.py)

## 1. Top Ten

- Write a function that queries the Reddit API and prints the titles of the
	first 10 hot posts listed for a given subreddit.

### Requirements:

Prototype: <code>def top_ten(subreddit)</code>
If not a valid subreddit, print None.
NOTE: Invalid subreddits may return a redirect to search results. Ensure that
you are not following redirects.

Mode: mandatory

File: [1-top_ten.py](./1-top_ten.py)
<hr>

## 2. Recurse it!

- Write a recursive function that queries the Reddit API and returns a list
	containing the titles of all hot articles for a given subreddit. If no results
	are found for the given subreddit, the function should return None.

### Requirements:

Prototype: <code>def recurse(subreddit, hot_list=[])</code>
Note: You may change the prototype, but it must be able to be called with just a
subreddit supplied. AKA you can add a counter, but it must work without
supplying a starting value in the main.
If not a valid subreddit, return None.
NOTE: Invalid subreddits may return a redirect to search results. Ensure that
you are not following redirects.

Mode: mandatory

File: [2-recurse.py](./2-recurse.py)
<hr>

## 3. Count it!

- Write a recursive function that queries the Reddit API, parses the title of
	all hot articles, and prints a sorted count of given keywords (
	case-insensitive, delimited by spaces. Javascript should count as javascript,
	but java should not).

### Requirements:

Prototype: <code>def count_words(subreddit, word_list)</code>
Note: You may change the prototype, but it must be able to be called with just a
subreddit supplied and a list of keywords. AKA you can add a counter or anything
else, but the function must work without supplying a starting value in the main.
If <code>word_list</code> contains the same word (case-insensitive), the final
count should be the sum of each duplicate (example below with <code>java</code>)
Results should be printed in descending order, by the count, and if the count is
the same for separate keywords, they should then be sorted alphabetically (
ascending, from A to Z). Words with no matches should be skipped and not
printed. Words must be printed in lowercase.
Results are based on the number of times a keyword appears, not titles it
appears in. <code>java java java</code> counts as 3 separate occurrences
of <code>java</code>.
To make life easier, <code>java.</code> or <code>java!</code> or <code>
java_</code> should not count as <code>java</code>
If no posts match or the subreddit is invalid, print nothing.
NOTE: Invalid subreddits may return a redirect to search results. Ensure that
you are NOT following redirects.
